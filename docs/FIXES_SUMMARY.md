# üîß Recent Fixes Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Payment Invoice Selection Issue** - FIXED ‚úÖ

**Problem**: When creating a payment, no invoices appeared in the dropdown even though invoices existed.

**Root Cause**: The payment form was only fetching invoices with `status=open`, but it should include all unpaid invoices.

**Solution**: Updated `components/billing/RecordPayment.tsx` to:
- Fetch all invoices (not just `status=open`)
- Filter client-side for unpaid invoices: `draft`, `open`, `overdue`
- Include partially paid invoices where balance is still due

### 2. **Missing Customer Creation in Payment Form** - ADDED ‚úÖ

**Enhancement**: Added ability to create new customers directly from the payment form.

**Features Added**:
- "Create New Customer" button in payment dialog
- New customer creation dialog with name, email, phone, type fields
- Auto-refresh of invoice list after customer creation
- Proper validation and error handling

### 3. **Environment Configuration** - ENHANCED ‚úÖ

**Improvements**:
- Updated `.env.local` with proper comments and organization
- Added all Supabase local development credentials
- Created comprehensive setup documentation
- Added helper scripts for environment setup
